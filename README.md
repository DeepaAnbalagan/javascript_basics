# JavaScript "use strict" overview 
1. Javascript Strict Mode 

- file level 
- function level 

Disadvantages of overall "strict" 
   - Concatenation of strict with non-strict makes both functions as strict (Not recommanded) 
Advantages of Strict 
   - doesn't allow features poorly coded 
   - Prevents the ussuage of future ES version keywords 
   - Ignores the silent errors by converting them to run time error 
   - fixes mistakes which makes it the javascript engine to run slower than optimized 
   
   
1. under strict mode 
- can't use (c=10)
- can't use (var eval =10, var arguments = 10)
- can't use (can't edit read only properties) 
- can't delete the functions and the variables
